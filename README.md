## 1. code for keyframe detection

> vid_demo.py and kf_det.py

code can be run under the directory of Detic.  
vid_demo.py reads the video data and does object detection on each single frame. This process takes about 10 hours to run and saves the boxes, scores, and masks of each video and detection frame.  
kf_det.py reads the detection results and saves a .csv file that records the detected keyframe.
